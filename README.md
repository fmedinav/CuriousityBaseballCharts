# CuriousityBaseballCharts
CuriosityBaseballCharts contains a group of charts retrieved from MLB data. It contains the algorithms in Python which retrieve the data and the correspondent chart from the Lahman's Data Base updated up to 2021.

This work is intended to be used as an excercise for retrieving data from a csv file using Python (Pandas Data Frames, Numpy arrays, and Matplotlib).
The Lahman's Database contains several csv files with different categories (Batting, Fielding, Teams, Franchises, etc.)
The target chart will probably requiere different files to be presented.
